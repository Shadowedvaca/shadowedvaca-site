            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a lifelong hobbyist programmer who's been coding since high school and loves the challenge of picking up new languages quickly. With over 20 years of professional data experience, I bring that same curiosity and self-taught approach to exploring AI technologies and building personal projects. When I'm not mentoring others or solving data puzzles professionally, you'll find me tinkering with code and bringing new ideas to life.</p>
